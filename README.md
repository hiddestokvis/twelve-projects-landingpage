# Twelve projects

## Introduction

Hey there! We are Boyan Lamboo and Hidde Stokvis and we work at Trunkrs, a logistical innovation company. The coming 6 months however we will be doing something new. We will be working on other projects... your projects! All projects will get 2 weeks of (ux) design and 2 weeks of development. What can we do? Hybrid apps (iOS/Android), (web) apps, websites, chatbots, .... whatever you dream up.

## How does it work?

We've got twelve slots. Starting at 0 euro and going up in steps of E1000,- to E11.000,-. You decide on which slot you want to pitch your project. Every two weeks we will pick a new project from the highest pitched slot. Every slot will only be open for one round. In theory the higher the slot, the more likely it will be we will pick your project, but he it's up to you guys!

## Ayo-Technology

We choose the technologies per project, but in general we will work with the Adobe suite or Sketch for design and we will use Node.JS, React (Native) and PostgreSQL for development. All original files will be delivered (PSD, code etc) and will be well documented so you can easily build on from there.

## So what is this?

This repo contains the front-end for our "Twelve-Projects" campaign website. It's made in react. We decided to open-source it so you can see how we work :) It's nothing much but feel free to use it in whatever way you see fit :)

## Back-end?

It's also open-source. You can find it [here](https://github.com/hiddestokvis/twelve-projects)
